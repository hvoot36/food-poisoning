    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The objective of this notebook is to address the reported cases of food poisoning among patrons who dined at a restaurant in suburban Banglore.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is achieved by using an unsupervised learning technique known as `clustering`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning method is a method in which we draw references from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Generally, it is used as a process to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings inherent in a set of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using `MiniBatchKMeans` as the estimator to conduct the unsupervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `MiniBatchKmeans` is a variant of the `KMeans` algorithm which uses mini-batches to reduce the computation time, while still attempting to optimise the same objective function."
